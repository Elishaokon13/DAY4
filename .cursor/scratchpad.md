# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Create an auto-commit script that commits changes made to every file with a commit message in the format "Modified{filename}". Make sure the auto-commit scripts themselves are not committed to git.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to detect file changes in the repository
- Need to automate git commits for each changed file individually
- Need to format commit messages correctly as "Modified{filename}"
- Need to ensure the script runs automatically
- Decide on the approach: git hooks vs file watcher
- Exclude certain directories (e.g., .git, node_modules) from triggering commits
- Ensure the auto-commit scripts themselves are not committed to git

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create a shell script that can detect modified files in the git repository
2. Implement logic to commit each changed file individually with the correct commit message format
3. Set up a way to run the script automatically (file watcher approach)
4. Test the script to verify it works as expected
5. Document usage instructions
6. Add auto-commit scripts to .gitignore

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create the auto-commit shell script
- [x] Create a file watcher script for automated triggering
- [x] Document how to use and customize the script
- [x] Add auto-commit scripts to .gitignore
- [ ] Test the scripts with manual file changes

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Completed:
- Created `auto-commit.sh` script to individually commit changed files
- Created `watch-and-commit.sh` script to automatically watch for file changes
- Made both scripts executable
- Created documentation in AUTO-COMMIT-README.md
- Added auto-commit scripts to .gitignore to prevent them from being committed

Pending:
- Testing the scripts with real file changes

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've implemented a solution using two shell scripts:
1. `auto-commit.sh` - The core script that detects and commits modified files
2. `watch-and-commit.sh` - A file watcher that triggers the auto-commit script when changes are detected

The implementation uses `fswatch` for file watching, which is commonly available on macOS. It should be installed via Homebrew if not already present.

Documentation is provided in AUTO-COMMIT-README.md with usage instructions.

Scripts have been added to .gitignore to prevent them from being committed to the repository.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- For file watching on macOS, fswatch is a good tool to use
