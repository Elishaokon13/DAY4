# BlogCoin - Next.js ERC-20 Blog Post Minting App

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a modern web application where users can write blog posts and mint them as ERC-20 coins on the Base Mainnet using Zora Coins SDK. The application will feature a sleek UI with Tailwind CSS, wallet connection via Privy, AI integration for content generation, IPFS storage with Pinata, and coin minting functionality.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integration of multiple technologies: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Privy wallet, OpenAI, Pinata IPFS, and Zora Coins SDK
- Ensuring smooth user experience across the writing, AI generation, IPFS upload, and minting workflow
- Building a responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI with dark/light mode functionality
- Handling blockchain interactions securely and efficiently
- Managing asynchronous operations (AI generation, IPFS uploads, blockchain transactions)
- Proper error handling for API calls and blockchain transactions

   **Success Criteria**: Blog content and images successfully upload to IPFS, returning valid URIs.

### 6. ERC-20 Coin Minting with Zora
- [x] 6.1 Configure Zora Coins SDK with Base Mainnet
- [x] 6.2 Create minting function using collected metadata (name, description, image URI)
- [x] 6.3 Implement transaction handling and confirmation
- [x] 6.4 Display transaction status and coin address
- [x] 6.5 Add link to view minted coin on blockchain explorer

   **Success Criteria**: ERC-20 coin mints successfully with correct metadata, transaction completes, coin address displays.

### 7. Testing and Refinement
- [ ] 7.1 Test complete user flow from writing to minting

   **Success Criteria**: Full application flow works seamlessly, responsive on all devices, error handling works correctly.

### 8. Documentation and Deployment
- [x] 8.1 Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [x] 8.2 Document .env requirements and API key setup
- [x] 8.3 Add inline code comments for complex operations
- [ ] 8.4 Prepare for deployment (Vercel or similar)
- [ ] 8.5 Final testing on deployed version

   **Success Criteria**: Documentation is clear and complete, deployment is successful.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
We have completed the implementation of almost all major components of the BlogCoin application:

1. Set up Next.js project with all required dependencies and configured Tailwind CSS with Inter font
2. Implemented all UI components including theme toggle, navbar, blog editor, buttons, and coin display
3. Set up Privy wallet authentication with a custom hook for accessing auth state
4. Created API routes for generating metadata with OpenAI (text and image)
5. Implemented IPFS upload functionality with Pinata
6. Set up ERC-20 coin minting with Zora Coins SDK
7. Created comprehensive documentation

**Update**: Fixed the Zora Coins SDK implementation to use the latest API. The previous implementation was using a non-existent `ZoraCoinsClient` class. We've updated it to use the proper `createCoin` function from the SDK along with Viem's public and wallet clients.

What remains to be done:
1. The .env.local file creation was blocked, but placeholders have been documented in the README
2. Testing the complete user flow (which requires API keys)
3. Deployment to a hosting platform

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
1. Unable to create the .env.local file due to globalIgnore blocking. We've instead documented the required environment variables in the README.md file.
2. There are some vulnerabilities in the dependencies (axios in @pinata/sdk and quill in react-quill). In a production environment, these should be addressed by either updating the dependencies or finding alternative libraries.
3. To fully test the application, we would need valid API keys for OpenAI, Privy, and Pinata.
4. For production deployment, a secure method for managing the minter's private key would be needed.
5. There was a TypeScript error in our Zora SDK implementation that we've now fixed. We updated it to use the correct API functions, imported from the SDK.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
- When dependencies have compatibility issues with newer React versions, use the --force flag with caution, as it might lead to runtime errors.
- Dynamically import React-Quill to avoid SSR issues, since it requires browser-specific APIs.
- When handling multiple asynchronous operations (AI generation, IPFS uploads, blockchain transactions), use proper error handling and loading states to provide a good user experience.
- When implementing third-party SDKs, check for recent updates to their API. The Zora Coins SDK changed its API from a client-based approach to a function-based approach.
- For ES2020+ features like BigInt literals, use constructor functions (e.g., `BigInt(0)` instead of `0n`) if targeting older JavaScript versions.
